# mega right click

**Extremely** basic CLI utility for downloading all the images in original quality from an EVM crypto wallet using the OpenSea API.

After installing mega right click, call it using `right-click`:

```bash
right-click <wallet> <apiKey>
```

Where `<wallet>` is your wallet address and `<apiKey>` is your API key. Alternatively, you can set these values in a `.env` file in the root directory of the project.
