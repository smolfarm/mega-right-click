# mega right click

**Extremely** basic utility for downloading all the images in original quality from an EVM crypto wallet.

Call the CLI using `right-click`:

```bash
right-click <wallet> <apiKey>
```

Where `<wallet>` is your wallet address and `<apiKey>` is your Opensea API key. Alternatively, you can set these values in a `.env` file in the root directory of the project.
